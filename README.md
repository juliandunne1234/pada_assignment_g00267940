The assignment concerns the numpy.random package in Python

There are four distinct tasks to be carried out in the jupyter notebook containing the assignment:

1. Explain the overall purpose of the package.
2. Explain the use of the "Simple random data" and "Permutations" functions.
3. Explain the use and purpose of at least five "Distributions" functions.
4. Explain the use of seeds in generating pseudorandom numbers.

The github repository for this assignment consists of a number of different files. This includes a Jupyter Notebook which is the completed assignment and also an excel file, a text file and a PNG and JPEG file. Each of these files are used within the jupyter notebook.

NOTE: The Jupyter Notebook has code cells have already been executed so that the relevant plots etc are visible once the file is opened in GitHub. However, there is a short game within the notebook whereby the user is asked to play a guessing game against the computer. The code for this game has not been executed and it will require the user to participate.
