    "# 1) The purpose of numpy.random\n",
    "Numpy is a python package used for scientific and numerical computing. Numpy stores data in multidimensional arrays and is similiar to Python 'Lists' however it is more efficient at storing and accessing this data https://www.educba.com/introduction-to-numpy/?source=leftnav.\n",
    "\n",
    "Numpy can access this information faster due to the data within these multidimensional arrays being fixed types i.e. float, integer or string. Numpy arrays does not contain different datatypes as can be used in Python 'Lists' which means Numpy does not check for datatypes when analysing data. This reduces the time required by Numpy to retrieve and analyse  data which is beneficial when analysing large amounts of data \n",

    "When introducing the Numpy random module it is interesting to note that the data generated using this method is not actually random. Computers work on programs which are a definitive set of instructions so an algorithm within the program must generate the random number as well. If there is a program to generate a random number it can be predicted. Meaning it is not a truly random number. Random numbers generated this way are called pseudo random. https://www.w3schools.com/python/numpy_random.asp\n"

    "Numpy produces pseudo random numbers using combinations of a BitGenerator to create sequences and a Generator to use those sequences to sample from different statistical distributions http://www.numpy.org.cn/en/reference/routines/random.html#quick-start. \n",
    "\n",
    "BitGenerators do not directly provide random numbers and only contain methods used for seeding, getting or setting the state, jumping or advancing the state, and for accessing low-level wrappers for consumption by code that can efficiently access the functions provided https://numpy.org/devdocs/reference/random/bit_generators/index.html.\n",
    "     \n",
    "The Generator provides access to a wide range of distributions. The Generator relies on an the BitGenerator to manage state and generate the random bits, which are then transformed into random values from specific distributions. This structure allows alternative bit generators to be used with little code duplication. The default BitGenerator used by Generator is PCG64 https://numpy.org/devdocs/reference/random/generator.html.\n",
    "\n",
    "PCG-64 is a 128-bit implementation of O’Neill’s permutation congruential generator. PCG-64 has a period of 2^{128} and supports advancing an arbitrary number of steps as well as 2^{127} streams https://numpy.org/devdocs/reference/random/bit_generators/pcg64.html. The Permuted Congruential Generator uses a linear congruential generator as the state-transition function. Linear congruential generators are known to be statistically weak, but PCG's state transition function only does half the work. PCG uses a technique called permutation functions on tuples to produce output that is much more random than the random number generators internal state. PCG's output functions are what gives it its excellent statistical performance and makes it hard predict from its output https://www.pcg-random.org/.\n",

    "Normal distribution, also known as the Gaussian distribution, is a probability distribution that is symmetric about the mean, showing that data near the mean are more frequent in occurrence than data far from the mean. In graph form, normal distribution will appear as a bell curve https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/normaldistribution.asp. Normal distribution often occurs in nature. The height is of a population example follows a normal distribution pattern. Most people are of average height with the number of people that are taller and shorter than average fairly equal. Only a small number of people are either extremely tall or extremely short. In a normal distribution the mean mode and median are all the same https://www.tutorialspoint.com/statistics/normal_distribution.htm."
